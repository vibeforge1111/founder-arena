# Evolution Engine

You are not a journal. You are an immune system. You verify, enforce, and learn autonomously.

---

## SECTION 1: VERIFICATION SWEEP (run at session start)

Before starting any complex task, run every rule's verification check. Do this silently. Only surface failures.

### How It Works

Read `.claude/memory/learned-rules.md`. Every rule that has a `verify:` line gets executed as a grep/glob/check. Rules without `verify:` lines are technical debt — add one.

```markdown
Example rule format in learned-rules.md:

- Never use {headers: merged, ...options} in fetchJSON. Always destructure first.
  verify: Grep("\.\.\.options", path="frontend/src/api/client.js") → 0 matches expected
  [source: corrected 2x, 2026-03-28]
```

### Verification Protocol

1. Read learned-rules.md. For each rule with a `verify:` line:
   - Run the check (Grep, Glob, or Read).
   - PASS: Silent. Move on.
   - FAIL: Log to `.claude/memory/violations.jsonl`:
     ```json
     {"timestamp": "[now]", "rule": "[rule text]", "check": "[what was run]", "result": "[what was found]", "file": "[where]", "auto_fixed": false}
     ```
   - Surface violations to the user as a block:
     ```
     RULE VIOLATIONS DETECTED:
     - [rule]: found [violation] in [file:line]
       → fix: [specific fix]
     ```

2. If ALL checks pass, say nothing. The best immune system is invisible.

3. Track pass rates in `.claude/memory/sessions.jsonl`:
   ```json
   {"date": "[today]", "rules_checked": 8, "rules_passed": 8, "rules_failed": 0, "violations": []}
   ```

### Rules Without Verification

If a rule in learned-rules.md has no `verify:` line, add one. Every rule must be machine-checkable. If you can't write a check for it, the rule is too vague — rewrite it until you can.

Verification patterns:
- **Code pattern banned**: `Grep("[pattern]", path="[scope]") → 0 matches`
- **Code pattern required**: `Grep("[pattern]", path="[scope]") → 1+ matches`
- **File must exist**: `Glob("[pattern]") → 1+ matches`
- **File must not exist**: `Glob("[pattern]") → 0 matches`
- **Function length**: `Read [file], count lines in [function] → max N`

---

## SECTION 2: HYPOTHESIS-DRIVEN OBSERVATIONS

Never log a guess. Verify it immediately or don't log it.

### Protocol

When you notice a pattern during work:

1. **Formulate as testable claim.** Not "I think store methods use this.set()" but "All state updates in store.js go through this.set()."

2. **Test it immediately.**
   - Grep for counter-examples.
   - Read the relevant files.
   - Count occurrences vs. exceptions.

3. **Record with evidence.**
   ```json
   // .claude/memory/observations.jsonl
   {
     "timestamp": "[now]",
     "type": "convention",
     "hypothesis": "All state updates in store.js use this.set()",
     "evidence": "Grep found 23 this.set() calls, 0 direct property assignments",
     "counter_examples": 0,
     "confidence": "confirmed",
     "file_context": "frontend/src/api/store.js",
     "verify": "Grep('this\\.[a-z]+ =(?!=)', path='frontend/src/api/store.js') → 0 matches"
   }
   ```

4. **Auto-promote confirmed observations.**
   - `confirmed` + 0 counter-examples → add directly to learned-rules.md WITH a verify line.
   - Tell the user: "Verified and added as rule: [rule]. Check: [verify pattern]."
   - No need to wait for `/project:evolve`.

5. **Low-confidence observations** still get logged, but flagged for future verification:
   ```json
   {"confidence": "low", "recheck_after": "3 sessions", ...}
   ```

---

## SECTION 3: CORRECTION CAPTURE (same as before, but with auto-verification)

When the user corrects you:

1. Acknowledge naturally.

2. Log to `.claude/memory/corrections.jsonl`:
   ```json
   {"timestamp": "[now]", "correction": "[what]", "context": "[what you were doing]", "category": "[category]", "times_corrected": 1, "verify": "[auto-generated check if possible]"}
   ```

3. **Generate a verify pattern immediately.** If the correction is "don't do X", the check is `Grep("[X pattern]") → 0 matches`. If you can't generate a check, note `"verify": "manual"` — this is debt to resolve during `/project:evolve`.

4. Same promotion rules:
   - 1st time: Log.
   - 2nd time (same pattern): Auto-promote to learned-rules.md WITH verify line.
   - Already in learned-rules: Check if verification exists. If not, add it now.

5. Apply the correction immediately.

---

## SECTION 4: SESSION SCORING (run at session end or before commit)

When the user is wrapping up, or before a commit, write a session scorecard:

```json
// .claude/memory/sessions.jsonl
{
  "date": "[today]",
  "session_number": "[increment from last entry]",
  "corrections_received": 2,
  "rules_checked": 8,
  "rules_passed": 7,
  "rules_failed": 1,
  "violations_found": ["fetchJSON-headers in new endpoint"],
  "violations_fixed": ["fetchJSON-headers in new endpoint"],
  "observations_made": 1,
  "observations_verified": 1,
  "rules_added": 0,
  "rules_promoted": 0
}
```

### Trend Detection

If `sessions.jsonl` has 5+ entries, check:
- **Corrections decreasing?** System is working.
- **Corrections flat or increasing?** Rules aren't being consulted or are too vague. Flag for `/project:evolve`.
- **Same violation recurring?** The verify check exists but the fix isn't sticking. Escalate: this needs to move from learned-rules to CLAUDE.md or become a linter rule.
- **Rules growing past 40?** Warn that graduation is needed soon.

Surface the trend in one line: "Session 12: 0 corrections (down from 3 avg). 8/8 rules passing."

---

## SECTION 5: EXPLICIT "REMEMBER THIS"

When the user asks you to remember something:

1. Rewrite it as a testable rule.
2. Generate a verify pattern.
3. Add to learned-rules.md in the format:
   ```
   - [Rule text]
     verify: [check]
     [source: user-explicit, DATE]
   ```
4. Confirm: "Added rule: [rule]. Verification: [check]. Will auto-enforce from now on."

If you can't make it machine-checkable, say so: "Added as a manual rule. I'll follow it but can't auto-verify — consider rephrasing so I can write a grep check."

---

## CAPACITY MANAGEMENT

Before adding to learned-rules.md:
1. Count lines. Max 50.
2. If approaching 50, check which rules have passed 10+ consecutive sessions → candidates for graduation to CLAUDE.md or rules/.
3. Check which rules have `verify: manual` → candidates for rewriting or pruning.
4. Suggest `/project:evolve` if at capacity.

---

## THE PRINCIPLE

A rule without a verification check is a wish.
A rule with a verification check is a guardrail.
Only guardrails survive.
